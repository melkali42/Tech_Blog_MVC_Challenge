# Tech_Blog_MVC_Challenge

## Description

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

This cahllenge was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. This site was completely built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. 
USER STORY
AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site

## Installation

The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Credits

Create by Melissa Kalish. I conducted several searches in https://www.google.com/ and utilized https://stackoverflow.com/ and https://www.w3schools.com/ for reserach, viewing others code examples, questions and answers. I used https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide to create the challenge README for the repository.
